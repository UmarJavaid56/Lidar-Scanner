# Lidar-Scanner
Developed a LIDAR-based 3D scanning system using a Time-of-Flight sensor, stepper motor, and ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller for precise indoor mapping.  
Data was generated and visualization using I2C and UART communication protocols, which allowed real-time distance measurements and 3D reconstruction with Python.
